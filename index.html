              <p class="places__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of
                the
                Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here,
                in
                which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty,
                but
                the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
                all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
                interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

              <p class="places__paragraph">The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock
                that
                juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some
                900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist
                destination during the summer months.</p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best
                ice
                cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim
                to
                fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular
                floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the
                office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

              <p class="places__paragraph">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is
                surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state,
                and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood
                items,
                galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local
                dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
                founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first
                to
                be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a full-tuition
                scholarship. </p>

              <p class="places__paragraph">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya
                was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the
                UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the country's
                political and economic capitals</p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think
                you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in
                the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea and coffee in the
                country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes,
                overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful
                mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is filled with
                beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which provide water around the
                country.</p>
